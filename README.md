1. [Drill](https://github.com/j-pard/becode-animation-css/tree/master/drill) :  
      Hover on button.  
      Change background color, font color, transform scale & translate-x.  
      

2. [Card](https://github.com/j-pard/becode-animation-css/tree/master/card) :  
      Animating card on hover.  
      Multiples animations :  
      * Increase size of bottom section
      * Displaying a text
      * Zoom on photo
      * Filter on photo  

      The principal challenge for me was about displaying correctly the text.  
      I used the _display: none_ / _display: block_ method.
